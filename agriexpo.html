            filled with solutions designed to increase productivity, reduce losses,
            and strengthen food security across the continent.

            The 9th Africa Agri Expo 2026 was more than an exhibition it was a vision
            of Africa’s agricultural future. The collaboration between global innovators,
            local enterprises, policymakers, and farmers demonstrated that the continent
            is not just participating in agricultural transformation — it is leading it.
        </p>

        <p>
            The energy and innovation  witnessed at KICC are any indication that
            Africa’s agricultural revolution is not coming ,it is already here.
