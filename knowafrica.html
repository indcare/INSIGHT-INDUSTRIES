    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
        Kenya stands among the world’s most remarkable tourism destinations, celebrated for its extraordinary diversity in landscapes, wildlife, and cultural heritage. Within a single country, visitors encounter sweeping savannah plains, palm-lined tropical beaches, vibrant coral reefs, dense equatorial forests, dramatic escarpments, and towering snow-capped mountains.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
        Often described as a world within itself, Kenya pioneered the African safari experience and has drawn explorers, conservationists, and travelers for generations. For many visitors, a journey through Kenya’s national parks and reserves is more than a holiday — it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-lg">
        While globally recognized for its safari industry, Kenya offers far more than wildlife viewing. The country combines archaeological treasures, preserved historical towns, vibrant cultures, mountain expeditions, adventure tourism, and coastal recreation. Annual cultural festivals across the country further enrich the visitor experience.

    <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-[#1b3d18] mb-6">Archaeological & Prehistoric Heritage</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
        Kenya holds one of the most extensive and significant records of early human development in the world. Archaeological discoveries across the country have contributed immensely to global understanding of human origins and cultural evolution.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
        Excavations in the Tugen Hills near Lake Baringo have revealed ancient fossil beds that date back millions of years. Equally important findings have been made in Sibiloi National Park along the shores of Lake Turkana, an area often referred to as the “Cradle of Mankind.”
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed text-lg">
        Additional archaeological sites include Hyrax Hill and Kariandusi near Nakuru, Rusinga Island in Lake Victoria, and Olorgesailie near Lake Magadi. These sites collectively position Kenya as a central location in the story of human civilization.

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
        Along Kenya’s coastline lie the remains of powerful Swahili city-states that flourished during the height of Indian Ocean trade. These settlements thrived through commerce with Arabia, Persia, India, and beyond.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
        The ancient town of Gede near Watamu prospered between the 13th and 17th centuries before being mysteriously abandoned. Today, its stone structures and winding pathways create an atmospheric reminder of a once-thriving civilization.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
        Takwa, located on Manda Island near Lamu, also experienced centuries of prosperity before declining in the 17th century. Meanwhile, the Old Towns of Malindi, Lamu, and Mombasa remain living historical centers, blending centuries-old architecture with vibrant modern communities.

        Kenya is home to 42 ethnic communities, each with its own language, customs, traditions, and social structures. This cultural diversity forms one of the country’s greatest strengths and most compelling attractions.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
        The Maasai, perhaps the most internationally recognized community, are admired for their warrior heritage, vibrant red attire, and intricate beadwork. The El Molo, one of the smallest communities, traditionally depend on fishing in Lake Turkana.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
        The nomadic Rendille rely heavily on camels for sustenance, transport, and trade. Along the coast, Swahili communities reflect centuries of cultural exchange with Arab and Persian traders. The Kalenjin community is globally renowned for producing elite long-distance runners and marathon champions.
